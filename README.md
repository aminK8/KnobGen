KnobGen, a dual-pathway framework that democratizes sketch-based image generation by seamlessly adapting to varying levels of sketch complexity and user skill. KnobGen employs a Coarse-Grained Controller (CGC) module for leveraging high-level semantics from both textual and sketch inputs in the early stages of generation, and a Fine-Grained Controller (FGC) module for detailed refinement later in the process.

# News

- [2024-09-27] ðŸ”¥ Initial release of KnobGen code!
- [2024-10-02] ðŸ”¥ The paper is released on arXiv.

# Installation
To set up the environment and start using KnobGen, please follow these steps:


1. `conda env create -f environment.yml`
2. `conda activate knobgen`

# Results

 Our method democratizes sketch-based image generation by effectively handling a broad spectrum of sketch complexity and user drawing abilityâ€”from novice sketches to those made by seasoned artistsâ€”while maintaining the natural appearance of the image.
