# KnobGen
## Controlling the Sophistication of Artwork in Sketch-Based Diffusion Models

KnobGen is a dual-pathway framework that empowers sketch-based image generation diffusion model by seamlessly adapting to varying levels of sketch complexity and user skill. KnobGen employs a Coarse-Grained Controller (CGC) module for leveraging high-level semantics from both textual and sketch inputs in the early stages of generation, and a Fine-Grained Controller (FGC) module for detailed refinement later in the process.
