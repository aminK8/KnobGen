## Controlling the Sophistication of Artwork in Sketch-Based Diffusion Models

KnobGen is a dual-pathway framework that empowers sketch-based image generation diffusion model by seamlessly adapting to varying levels of sketch complexity and user skill. KnobGen employs a Coarse-Grained Controller (CGC) module for leveraging high-level semantics from both textual and sketch inputs in the early stages of generation, and a Fine-Grained Controller (FGC) module for detailed refinement later in the process.

## Installation
To set up the environment, please follow these steps in the terminal:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/aminK8/KnobGen.git
cd KnobGen
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate knobgen
```

## Prepare the Dataset
We utilized the MultiGen-20M dataset, originally introduced by [UniControl](https://github.com/salesforce/UniControl).

## Train

For run training, use the appropriate command based on the model:

```bash
# For T2I-Adapter:
bash job_adapter_training.sh

# For ControlNet:
bash job_controlnet_training.sh
```

## Inference

To run inference, use the appropriate command based on the model:

```bash
# For T2I-Adapter:
bash job_adapter_inference.sh

# For ControlNet:
bash job_controlnet_inference.sh
```

## Results

 Our method democratizes sketch-based image generation by effectively handling a broad spectrum of sketch complexity and user drawing abilityâ€”from novice sketches to those made by seasoned artistsâ€”while maintaining the natural appearance of the image.
