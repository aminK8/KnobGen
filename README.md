# KnobGen

KnobGen, a dual-pathway framework that democratizes sketch-based image generation by seamlessly adapting to varying levels of sketch complexity and user skill. KnobGen uses a Coarse-Grained Controller (CGC) module for high-level semantics in the early stages of generation and a Fine-Grained Controller (FGC) module for detailed refinement later in the process.
